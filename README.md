Ever get lost in your document, and not know where you are? Make your Roam Research headings 'sticky' so that when you scroll down your headings stick at the top of the page.

No configuration is required. When the extension is loaded any blocks set as H1, H2 or H3 in your graph will be sticky. When you scroll down the page, the heading blocks will stick at the top until another heading of the same level reaches the top.

The extension will adjust for any css tweaks you apply, including using themes of even Roam Studio. Just make sure to reload the Sticky Headings extension after changing your styles and will pick up the new styles and correct for them.
